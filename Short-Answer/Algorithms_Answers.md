#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n), It is linear and runs n times.


b)O(nlog(n)), it contains a for-loop and a nested loop.


c)O(n), there is a conditional statement but there is no nested condition so it still runs n times.

## Exercise II
start at floor 1 incrementing until the first egg breaks at floor f than perform a recursive binary search in the range between the starting floor and f as the range gets smaller and smaller until the worst case is found.
Time complexity is O(log n)
